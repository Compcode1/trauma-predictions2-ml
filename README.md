This project is structured to explore concepts and derive Conclusiuons in a workbook semi structured fashion. It is an exploratory project, not designed to be comprhensive or designed finish product structured. It serves to provide comprehensive notations on topics explored. The following is the basic workflow: 


 **1. Data Loading Block:**
Purpose: This initial block is used to load the medical records dataset (medrecords.csv) into a pandas DataFrame.
What's Executed: The dataset is read from a file using pandas.read_csv(), and the first few rows of the dataset are displayed for verification. The dataset contains various health-related features such as Age, Gender, Heart Disease, Stroke, Exam Score, and High Alcohol.
Outcome: The dataset is successfully loaded into memory, and its structure and content are confirmed through a preview of the first few rows.(DESCRIBE THE TYPES OF DATA SEEN AND THE ANTICIPATED STEPS THAT WILL BE NECESSARY SINCE THIS IS A MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT)

**2. Creating the Trauma Target Column:**
Purpose: This block creates the Trauma column, which serves as the target variable for machine learning models.
What's Executed:
The Trauma column is initialized with all values set to 0.
A series of conditions are applied to probabilistically assign 1 (trauma) to rows based on different health factors:
Individuals aged 65 or older have a 50% chance of trauma.
Individuals with Alzheimer's have a 75% chance.
Individuals with High Alcohol, Heart Disease, Stroke, and low Exam Score are probabilistically assigned trauma based on different probabilities.
Remaining rows are assigned trauma with a 10% chance.
Outcome: The Trauma target column is created, and the dataset is now labeled for a classification task. Trauma percentages are also calculated and displayed, giving insight into the distribution of trauma cases across the dataset.

**Output Summary**

- **37.57%** of the dataset rows are marked as having trauma.
- Trauma distribution by age group:
  - **18-44**: 31.11% have trauma.
  - **45-64**: 32.82% have trauma.
  - **65+**: 57.57% have trauma.


**General Predictions About Machine Learning Success**
- Given the deterministic rules and probabilistic nature of the trauma assignment, machine learning models are likely to learn the associations between trauma and health conditions like age, Alzheimer's, alcohol consumption, heart disease, stroke, and exam scores.
- Features such as **Alzheimer's**, **Age**, and **Stroke** should exhibit stronger correlations with trauma due to their higher trauma assignment probabilities.
- **Success in prediction** depends on how well these conditions align with the overall trauma distribution. However, since trauma has been probabilistically assigned, machine learning models like **XGBoost** should be able to detect patterns effectively.
- With a **37.57% trauma rate**, the data is moderately balanced, making it feasible to train machine learning models without significant bias towards one class.

**3. One-Hot Encoding and Data Preparation for Machine Learning:**
Purpose: This block prepares the dataset for machine learning by transforming categorical variables into a suitable format and splitting the dataset.
What's Executed:
**One-hot encoding** is applied to categorical variables such as Gender, Age Group, and Exam Age, converting them into binary columns (e.g., Gender_Male, Age Group_45-64).
The dataset is split into features (X) and target (y), where X contains all columns except Trauma, and y is the Trauma column.
The data is split into training and testing sets (80% for training, 20% for testing).
Outcome: The dataset is now preprocessed and split into training and testing sets, ready for model training.

4. **XGBoost Model** Training and Evaluation:
Purpose: Train an XGBoost classifier to predict trauma based on medical records.
XGBoost is an efficient and powerful implementation of gradient boosting designed for speed, accuracy, and flexibility.
It uses sequential decision trees to minimize the prediction error and applies gradient descent to optimize performance.
Regularization techniques, feature subsampling, and parallelism allow XGBoost to handle large datasets while preventing overfitting.
The High Alcohol feature's dominance, as identified in subsequent analysis, is the result of XGBoost assigning significant importance to features that strongly correlate with the target variable (Trauma), which may require scaling or tuning adjustments.(Not executed in this exploratory project. )

When using XGBoost, tuning its hyperparameters can significantly impact model performance. Key hyperparameters include:

**n_estimators:** The number of trees to build.
n_estimators (Number of Trees)
Description:
This controls the number of trees that are built sequentially in the ensemble model. In gradient boosting, each new tree attempts to reduce the error of the previous trees.
More trees allow the model to correct more errors, but too many trees can lead to overfitting.
Default: 100
When to Alter:
Increase: If the model is underfitting (i.e., it has high bias and is too simple), increasing n_estimators allows the model to capture more complex patterns. This is often paired with a lower learning_rate.
Decrease: If the model is overfitting (i.e., performing very well on training data but poorly on test data), reducing n_estimators might help by preventing over-complexity.
Best Practice: Increasing n_estimators should usually be accompanied by a reduction in learning_rate to avoid overfitting, as more trees increase the risk of memorizing the training data.

**max_depth**: The maximum depth of each tree, which controls the complexity of the model. (Maximum Depth of Each Tree)
Description:
This controls the maximum depth of each decision tree in the model. The depth of the tree indicates how many times the model can split the data on different features. Deeper trees can model more complex relationships but also increase the risk of overfitting.
Default: 6
When to Alter:
Increase: If the model is underfitting and failing to capture the complexity of the data, increasing max_depth allows the trees to split the data more finely and learn more intricate patterns.
Decrease: If the model is overfitting, reducing max_depth limits the model's capacity to make overly specific splits and forces it to focus on more general patterns.
Best Practice: Start with a small depth (e.g., 3-6) to prevent overfitting, especially on small or noisy datasets. Gradually increase max_depth if the model is underfitting.

**learning_rate**(aka eta): Controls how much each tree contributes to the final predictions. A smaller learning rate requires more trees.
Description:
This controls the contribution of each tree to the final prediction. It acts as a shrinkage factor on the treeâ€™s predictions, reducing their impact and making the model learn more slowly.
A smaller learning_rate means each tree corrects only a small portion of the error, requiring more trees to achieve the same results.
Default: 0.3
When to Alter:
Decrease: If the model is overfitting or you want to improve the generalization ability, decrease the learning_rate. This often requires increasing the number of trees (n_estimators) to make up for the smaller contribution of each tree.
Increase: If the model is underfitting or training is too slow, a higher learning_rate can speed up learning by making each tree more impactful.
Best Practice: Lower learning_rate values (e.g., 0.01-0.1) are generally preferred to ensure the model learns gradually and doesn't overfit. Pair this with a higher n_estimators (number of trees) for best results.

**min_child_weight** Controls the minimum sum of instance weights (hessian) needed in a child node, affecting when splits occur.
Description:
This parameter controls the minimum sum of the instance weights (hessian) required in a child node. In simpler terms, it governs the minimum number of samples that a tree node must have in order to make a split.
Default: 1
When to Alter:
Increase: If the model is overfitting, increasing min_child_weight ensures that nodes must have a larger number of samples before they can split, thus preventing overly specific splits.
Decrease: If the model is underfitting or struggling to make good splits, lowering min_child_weight allows the model to create more specific branches in the tree by allowing splits with fewer samples.
Best Practice: Start with the default value and increase it if the model is overfitting or has many noisy splits. A higher min_child_weight (e.g., 5-10) forces the model to generalize more.

**gamma:** Controls the minimum reduction in the loss function needed for a split to occur.
Description:
This parameter controls the minimum reduction in the loss function that a split needs to achieve in order to be made. If a split doesn't meet this reduction threshold, it is not created. This parameter can be used to control overfitting.
Default: 0
When to Alter:
Increase: If the model is overfitting, increasing gamma forces the model to only make splits that significantly reduce the error. This reduces the tendency to make unnecessary, small improvements in the training data.
Decrease: In rare cases where the model is underfitting, decreasing gamma allows the model to make more splits even when the error reduction is small.
Best Practice: Start with gamma = 0 (the model splits freely) and increase it if the model starts to overfit. Higher values like 1-5 can help prevent overfitting in very complex datasets.

**subsample:** The percentage of training instances used to grow each tree, controlling overfitting.
subsample
Description:
This parameter controls the percentage of the training data used to build each tree. By sampling only a fraction of the data, the model introduces randomness, which can help prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
Default: 1 (100% of the data is used)
When to Alter:
Decrease: If the model is overfitting, reduce subsample to introduce more randomness and make the model less dependent on the full training set. Typical values are between 0.5 and 0.8.
Increase: If the model is underfitting or not learning enough from the data, increasing subsample ensures that each tree has access to more of the training data.
Best Practice: Set subsample to a value between 0.5 and 0.8 to prevent overfitting. This works especially well in large datasets where using a portion of the data for each tree is computationally efficient and beneficial for generalization.



**colsample_bytree:** The fraction of features used in each tree, which reduces correlation between trees and helps prevent overfitting.
Description:
This parameter controls the fraction of features (columns) used by each tree. By using only a subset of features for each tree, colsample_bytree introduces diversity into the trees, reducing the likelihood of the model overfitting.
Default: 1 (100% of the features are used in each tree)
When to Alter:
Decrease: If the model is overfitting, reducing colsample_bytree ensures that each tree only has access to a subset of features, which helps prevent reliance on any one feature or set of features. Common values range from 0.3 to 0.8.
Increase: If the model is underfitting, increasing colsample_bytree allows the model to use more features, which can help it learn more complex patterns in the data.
Best Practice: A value between 0.5 and 0.8 is often optimal for balancing overfitting and underfitting, especially when you have a large number of features. This is similar to how Random Forests use feature bagging.




What's Executed:
The XGBoost classifier is trained on the training set.
Predictions are made on the test set.
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as:
Accuracy: How often the model correctly predicts trauma.
Precision: The proportion of trauma predictions that are correct.
Recall: The proportion of actual trauma cases that are correctly identified.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Outcome: The XGBoost model is trained, and performance metrics are calculated and displayed. The model's effectiveness at predicting trauma is assessed through accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

**Accuracy**: 68.84%
  - This indicates that about 69% of the modelâ€™s predictions are correct, which is moderate but not exceptional.
  
- **Precision**: 56.49%
  - Precision is relatively low, meaning that when the model predicts trauma, it is only correct 56% of the time. This suggests that the model is  generating a relatively high number of false positives (cases where it incorrectly predicts trauma).
  
- **Recall**: 75.08%
  - Recall is higher, indicating that the model correctly identifies 75% of actual trauma cases. This is a positive sign as it means that most trauma cases are being caught by the model.
  
- **F1 Score**: 64.47%
  - The F1 score is a balance between precision and recall. A score of **64.47%** is considered moderate, meaning the model strikes a fair balance between identifying trauma cases and avoiding false positives.

  The lower precision is not necessarily a flaw in the model, but rather a consequence of the way trauma was assigned in the dataset and the model's bias towards maximizing recall. Improvements could be made by refining the feature set or tuning the model to better balance precision and recall based on the use case requirements.

- The initial XGBoost model demonstrates moderate performance with an F1 score of **64.47%**. The high recall shows the model is effective at identifying trauma cases, but the lower precision suggests room for improvement, particularly in reducing false positives. Further tuning or feature engineering might be needed to improve the precision without significantly sacrificing recall.

  

**5. Feature Importance**
Purpose: This block analyzes the importance of different features in the trained XGBoost model.
What's Executed:
Feature importances are extracted from the XGBoost model and ranked in descending order.
A bar plot is generated to visualize the importance of each feature in making predictions.
The importance of the High Alcohol feature is found to be much higher compared to other features, highlighting its significant influence in trauma prediction.
Outcome: The High Alcohol feature stands out as the most influential variable, prompting further exploration and adjustment in subsequent modeling efforts.

The **top 5 features** contributing to trauma prediction are:
  1. **High Alcohol**: 0.6362 (by far the most important feature)
  2. **Heart Disease**: 0.0987
  3. **Stroke**: 0.0790
  4. **Age**: 0.0712
  5. **Alzheimers**: 0.0105
  

**6. Confusion Matrix Visualization:**
Purpose: Visualize the model's performance through a confusion matrix.
What's Executed:
A confusion matrix is generated based on the test set predictions, showing the number of true positives (correct trauma predictions), false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.
The confusion matrix is plotted as a heatmap for easier interpretation.
Outcome: The confusion matrix provides a visual breakdown of the modelâ€™s performance, showing where it made correct predictions and errors.

**7. Random Forest Model with Feature Scaling (Optional Block):**
Purpose: Experiment with scaling down the importance of the High Alcohol feature to observe its effect on model performance.
What's Executed:
The dataset is copied, and the High Alcohol feature is scaled down by dividing its values by a scaling factor (2, 3, or 4).
A Random Forest classifier is trained on the scaled data, and the same evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score) are computed.


Outcome: The impact of reducing the weight of the High Alcohol feature is analyzed by observing how the Random Forest modelâ€™s performance changes under different scaling factors.

XGBoost Hyperparameter tuning results versus 1st Run with Default Settings
Summary of Improvement:
Lower learning rate and fewer trees allowed the model to generalize better.
A reduced tree depth helped the model avoid overfitting.
The improvement in recall suggests the model is better at identifying trauma cases, while the slight drop in precision indicates that it's making more false positives, but that trade-off increased the overall F1 score.
